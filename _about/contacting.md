## Press Inquiries

For press inquiries regarding WAI or web accessibility, please send e-mail to [shawn@w3.org, w3t-pr@w3.org, wai@w3.org](mailto:shawn@w3.org,w3t-pr@w3.org,wai@w3.org?subject=press%20request-accessibility)

## Technical, Implementation, and other Support Questions

Many questions are addressed in documents on the WAI site. For example,
[Understanding WCAG 2.0](/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/) provides extensive
guidance on making Web sites accessible, including the intent of
guidelines and success criteria; how they help people with different
disabilities, browser and assistive technology support notes, examples,
and resources. The [WAI site map](/sitemap/) lists all documents and
[search](/search/) is available to look for specific information.

Current Web accessibility issues are discussed through the WAI mailing
lists, which are archived and visible to the public. The [WAI Interest
Group](/WAI/IG/) is a public forum for discussion of issues relating to
Web accessibility. If you have a question that might be relevant to the
WAI IG list, you can:

-   Search the [WAI IG list archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/) to see if it has already been addressed sufficiently
-   Read the [Mailing Lists](/WAI/about/groups/waiig/#mailinglist) section of the WAI IG page
-   [Subscribe to the Discussion List](/WAI/about/groups/waiig/#subscribing-and-unsubscribing-to-the-discussion-list) and
    post appropriate questions

## Feedback on Specific Documents

To submit comments on a specific document:

-   Many WAI resources are on GitHub and you can create issues and
    submit pull requests. Look for the GitHub links near the bottom of
    the page.
-   WAI resource documents have a specific e-mail address for submitting
    comments, which is usually **at the bottom of the document**. This
    is usually: <wai-eo-editors@w3.org> (a public list)
-   W3C Recommendations and W3C Working Drafts have **in the Status
    section** an e-mail address to send comments.

If you cannot determine where to send comments, send an e-mail with the
document name in the subject line to: <wai@w3.org> and we will forward
your message to the appropriate place. Please include permission to send
it to a publicly-archived e-mail list.

## Feedback on the WAI Web Site

You can submit comments on the overall WAI Web site (www.w3.org/WAI/) either to a W3C WAI staff list or to a public list:

-   <team-site-design@w3.org> (for WAI staff, not public)
-   <wai-site-comments@w3.org> (can be seen by the public)

Comments on other parts of the W3C Web site (www.w3.org) go to: <site-comments@w3.org>
