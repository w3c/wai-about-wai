## About the Project
{:#about}

WAI-Guide, Authoritative Implementation Guidance and International Cooperation to Support Training, Awareness Raising, and Capacity Building, is an Support Action project, co-funded by the European Commission (EC) under the Horizon 2020 program (Grant Agreement 822245). The project started on 1 January 2019 for a duration of three years. WAI-Guide aims to:

-   Provide authoritative implementation guidance and training, thereby growing capacities of available accessibility experts;
-   Accelerate tooling support for accessible content authoring, thereby making it more cost efficient to create accessible content;
-   Identify and address gaps in accessibility standardization, thereby increasing the coverage of digital accessibility requirements.

WAI-Guide achieves this by conducting its work as an integral part of the vendor-neutral environment of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). WAI-Guide draws together expertise from industry, end-user representation, public bodies, research, and other fields, to develop core accessibility solutions that are internationally consensed and recognized as authoritative references.
