Participation at the event is free of charge, but registration is compulsory. The registration deadline is 5 January 2023.

## Introduction
{:#introduction}

This online symposium brings together researchers, academics, industry, government, and people with disabilities, to explore one the most pressing emerging technologies, Artificial Intelligence, and potential impacts on accessibility. This symposium aims to identify current challenges and opportunities raised by the increasing use of AI regarding digital accessibility and explore how ongoing research can leverage and hinder digital accessibility.
After the symposium, the WAI-CooP project will publish a report, consolidating the discussions and findings.
