## Invitation
{:#invitation}

The Web Accessibility Initiative - Communities of Practice ([WAI-CooP](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-coop/)) Project and the W3C Accessible Platform Architectures ([APA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/)) Working Group invite researchers, practitioners, and users with disabilities to participate in an international online symposium exploring the positive and negatives impact of Artificial Intelligence in digital accessibility.

- Symposium date: **10 - 11 January 2023**


Participation at the event is free of charge, but registration is compulsory. The registration deadline is 5 January 2023.

## Introduction
{:#introduction}

This online symposium brings together researchers, academics, industry, government, and people with disabilities, to explore one the most pressing emerging technologies, Artificial Intelligence, and potential impacts on accessibility. This symposium aims to identify current challenges and opportunities raised by the increasing use of AI regarding digital accessibility and explore how ongoing research can leverage and hinder digital accessibility.
After the symposium, the WAI-CooP project will publish a report, consolidating the discussions and findings.

### Opening Keynote: Jutta Treviranus


### Day 1
#### Panel 1: Computer Vision for Media Accessibility
- Amy Pavel (University of Texas, US)
- Shivam Singh (Accenture, India)
- Michael Cooper (W3C, US)

This panel aims to discuss the current state of computer vision techniques focused on image recognition, supporting the identification and recognition of elements and text in web images and media, potentially considering the different usage contexts of the web. This discussion will be focused on aspects such as quality and accuracy of current computer vision techniques, as well as on opportunities and future directions for computer vision for media accessibility.

#### Panel 2: Natural Language Processing for Media Accessibility
- Amy Pavel (University of Texas, US)
- Shivam Singh (Accenture, India)
- Michael Cooper (W3C, US)
- Shaomei Wu (AImpower.org, US)

This panel aims to discuss the current state of natural language processing techniques employed, among other, to generate textual descriptions for images and other visual media present on web pages. This discussion will be focused on aspects such as text adaptation, and providing understandable text to better meet web user needs and contexts, as well as potential avenues for natural language processing for media accessibility.

### Day 2
#### Panel 1: Machine Learning for Web accessibility evaluation
- Willian Massami Watanabe (Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná, BR)
- Yeliz Yesilada (Middle East Technical University, TR)
- Sheng Zhou (Zhejiang University, CH)

This panel aims to discuss the current state of machine learning algorithms to support and improve methodologies for assessing web accessibility. This discussion will be focused on web accessibility metrics, web pages sampling, evaluation of dynamic web pages, as well as on opportunities and future directions for machine learning for web accessibility evaluation.

#### Panel 2: Natural Language Processing for Accessible Communication
- Chaohai Ding (University of Southampton, UK)
- Lourdes Moreno (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, ES)
- Vikas Ashok (Old Dominion University, US)

This panel aims to discuss the current state of natural language processing techniques to enhance accessible communication on the web. This discussion will be focused on machine translation techniques supporting localization of web contents, speech to text and text to speech techniques, technology-mediated communication, as well as on opportunities and future directions for natural language processing for accessible communication.


### Closing Keynote: Shari Trewin
