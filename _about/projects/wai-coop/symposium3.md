The Web Accessibility Initiative - Communities of Practice ([WAI-CooP](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-coop/)) Project invites researchers, practitioners, and users with disabilities to participate in an international online symposium exploring best practices and challenges in accessibility evaluation and monitoring.

- Symposium date: **16 November 2023**

Participation at the event is free of charge, but [registration](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/1/WAI-CooP_symposium3/) is compulsory. The [registration](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/1/WAI-CooP_symposium3/) deadline is 7 November 2023. 

## Introduction
{:#introduction}

This online symposium brings together researchers, academics, industry, government, and people with disabilities, to explore practices and challenges involved in monitoring and evaluating digital accessibility. We aim to focus this discussion on current challenges and opportunities in three main areas, digital accessibility training, mobile accessibility, and Artificial Intelligence. 

This symposium aims to foster a common discussion between researchers and practitioners to work in collaboration to discuss opportunities to improve the current state of accessibility research and practice.

After the symposium, the WAI-CooP project will publish a report, consolidating the discussions and findings.
