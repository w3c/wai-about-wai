**[List of Courses on Digital Accessibility](https://github.com/w3c/wai-course-list/)**
:  Includes developing a user interface with filtering functionality, a taxonomy to describe courses and certification on digital accessibility with mapping to the [WAI Curricula](https://www.w3.org/WAI/curricula/), and promoting and gathering list entries. An [early prototype List of Courses](https://deploy-preview-4--wai-course-list.netlify.app/course-list/) and [Courses submission form](https://deploy-preview-4--wai-course-list.netlify.app/course-list/submit-a-resource) is available. This work is being carried out in the [W3C Accessibility Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/eowg/).

**[Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/)**
:  Includes promoting, tracking, and validating implementations of "Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules" in automated testing tools and manual testing methodologies. This includes completed [redesign of the user interface](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/about/) to better integrate implementation reports submitted by different vendors. This work is being carried out in the [ACT Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/) of the W3C Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AGWG).

## About the Project
{:#about}

WAI-CooP, Communities of Practice, is a Coordination and Support Action project, co-funded by the European Commission (EC) under the Horizon 2020 program (Grant Agreement 101004794). The project is schedule to start on 1 January 2021 for a duration of three years. WAI-CooP support implementation of the international standards for digital accessibility through:

-   Establishing vendor-neutral overview on available training, tools, and resources internationally
-   Analyzing technological advancements and coordinating with relevant research and development
-   Providing opportunities for key stakeholders to share resources and to exchange best practices

WAI-CooP achieves this by building on the existing wealth of authoritative guidance available from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), to provide a one-stop shop for the broad spectrum of key stakeholders involved in the implementation of digital accessibility. This includes public bodies and private entities; organisations representing people with disabilities; product, service, and training providers; researchers; and policy makers.
