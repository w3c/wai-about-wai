## Introduction

@@

After each item, is the acronym of the responsible Working Group:
* AG WG = Accessibility Guidelines Working Group
* APA WG = Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group 
* ARIA WG = Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group
* EOWG = Accessibility Education and Outreach Working Group
* EPUB3 WG = EPUB3 Working Group 

TF = Task Force under a Working Group

## Updating Core Guidelines and Other Standards

* **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2** is in progress. The current plan is to publish the final version by June 2022. Note that these links have information that will change: [What's New in WCAG 2.2 Working Draft](/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/), [WCAG 2.2 Editor's Draft ](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/) _[AG WG]_

* **W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0** an early draft of a few aspects of a potential new standard. It is years away from being finalized. [[WCAG 3 Introduction]](/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/), [About Accessibility Guidelesines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag) _[AG WG]_

* **ARIA** @@ _[ARIA WG]_

## Developing New Standards

* **Personalization** (renaming in progress, maybe _Personalized Adaptation_) involves tailoring the user experience to meet the needs and preferences of the individual user. [[Personalization Overview]](/personalization/) _[APA WG, Personalization TF]_

* **Spoken Pronunciation** technical standards are being developed to enable screen readers and voice assistants to pronounce words correctly. [[Pronunciation Overview]](/pronunciation/) _[APA WG, Spoken Pronunciation TF]_

* **EPUB 3.3**, the EPUB standard is coming to W3C as a recommendation in version 3.3, including updates to the core specification and EPUB Accessibility 1.1. EPUB3WG plans to move these documents to Candidate Recommendation at the end of March. [[EPUB-33]], [[EPUB-RS-33]], and [[EPUB-A11Y-11]] _[EPUB3 WG]_ 

## Documenting Additional Guidance for People with Cognitive Disabilities, Low Vision, and Mobile Devices

* **Cognitive** &mdash; There are several documents being updated to better address the needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities. See [[Cognitive Accessibility at W3C]](/cognitive/). _[AG WG, COGA TF]_

* **Low Vision**  &mdash; We are writing guidance that goes beyong the minimums required by WCAG. It is called "supplemental guidance". Current topics cover proximity, printing, and alternative themes such as high contrast and dark mode. _[AG WG, Low Vision TF]_

* [[Mobile Accessibility at W3C]](/standards-guidelines/mobile/) @@ _[AG WG, Mobile TF]_

* **Fixed Layout Accessibility Best Practices** &mdash; The EPUB3WG is working on best practices documentation for fixed layout ebooks, including considerations for people with cognitive disabilities or low vision. This document is aimed at helping publishers to produce more accessible fixed layout content while also exploring some of the challenges present with the format. See [Fixed Layout Accessibility](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/fxl-a11y/) _[EPUB3WG, FXL A11y TF]_ 

## Defining User Requirements (AUR) and Emerging Technologies

Documenting the user needs of people with disabilities helps develop standards to meet those needs. It also helps designers, developers, and others better understand and meet user needs in order to support accessibility.

* **Natural Language Interface Accessibility User Requirements ("NAUR")** is a Working Draft. A natural language interface is a user interface in which the user and the system communicate via a natural (human) language. The user provides input as sentences via speech or other input, and the system generates responses as sentences delivered by speech, text, or another modality. [About  NAUR](https://www.w3.org/blog/2021/10/natural-language-interface-accessibility-user-requirements-call-for-review/), [NAUR Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/naur)  _[APA WG, Research TF]_

* **XR Accessibility User Requirements (XAUR)** is a Working Draft. XAUR describes the needs of people with disabilities in virtual or immersive environments (XR). It includes requirements for XR to be accessible. XAUR is for designers and developers who are involved in creating XR experiences. [XAUR Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/xaur/) _[APA WG, Research TF]_

* **Synchronization Accessibility User Requirements (SAUR)** is a Working Draft. Synchronization of multimedia content, especially audio and video, is essential for accessible web-based communication and cooperation. To be understandable, media needs to be synchronized to very specific limits. [SAUR Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/saur/) _[APA WG, Research TF]_

* **How People with Disabilities Use the Web** helps you understand user needs broadly. We are updating this resrouce and creating videos to go along with it. [[How People with Disabilities Use the Web]](/people-use-web/) _[EOWG]_

* **Cognitive accessibility user requirements** &mdash; Updating documentation on the user needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities is happening through the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA).  _[AG WG, COGA TF]_

## Teaching Accessibility

**Curricula on Web Accessibility** is a framework to build your own courses. It currently includes modules for foundations for everyone, for developers, and for designers. We are currently working on modules for content authors. [[Existing Curricula]](/curricula/), [Content Authors rough draft outline](https://github.com/w3c/wai-curricula/wiki/content-author-modules-outline) _[EOWG]_

## Testing Accessibility

**WCAG 2 Test Rules** (also known as ACT Rules) describe how to test conformance to WCAG success criteria. They are primarily for developers of evaluation tools and test methodologies. [[About WCAG 2 Test Rules]](/standards-guidelines/act/rules/about/) _[AG WG, ACT TF]_
