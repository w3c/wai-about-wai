## W3C WAI

- When "W3C" is not with "World Wide Web Consortium", treat "W3C" as a stand-alone name, not an acronym.
- Do not write it out in the translation if it is not written out in the English version.  
- Treat "W3C", "W3C WAI", and "WAI" as a proper noun.
- In most gender-based languages, don't use an article.

_Background:_ [French glossary issue](https://github.com/w3c/translation-glossaries/issues/31) & [W3C media kit](https://www.w3.org/about/press-media/)

## Acronyms WCAG, ARIA, EOWG, etc.
For W3C Working Group names and Technical Reports, translate the words written out. Leave the acronym in English. 

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="" %}
{:/}
- in English: <q>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</q>
- in German: <q>Richtlinien für barrierefreie Webinhalte (WCAG)</q>

## WCAG 2 and WCAG 3 are different

WCAG 3
: W3C Accessibility Guidelines

WCAG 2
: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

## Capitalize W3C terms
W3C process-related terms should be translated and capitalized. This includes:
- Groups: Working Group, Interest Group, Business Group, Community Group, Task Force.
- W3C bodies: W3C Members, Team, Advisory Board, Advisory Committee, Technical Architecture Group
- Technical Reports: Working Group Note, Interest Group Note, Working Draft, First Public Working Draft, Recommendation, Proposed Recommendation, Candidate Recommendation.

Note: W3C Members are organizations. Individuals in groups are "participants" in a group (not "members" of a group).

## Capitalization - titles and headings
W3C documents use headline-style capitalization (where every major word is capitalized) for document titles. Some also use headline-style capitalization for headings within the document (including h1, h2, etc.).

Translations should use the proper capitalization for your language.

## You
- Use formal form of "you".
- If you think the informal "you" is better in your language, please open a GitHub issue for gathering input from others.
- Background: GitHub issue: "you" translate formal
- (Example of "you" in a W3C WAI resource: You may use this video if you include a link to this page. (in context))
