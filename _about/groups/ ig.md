## Introduction

The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Interest Group (IG) promotes awareness of, and engagement in, accessibility work throughout the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). More details are in [About WAI IG below](#about-wai-ig).

**Other Interest Group Pages:**

-   [Charter](/WAI/IG/20200804)
-   [Discussion E-mail List Archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/)
-   [Announcements E-mail List Archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wai-announce/)

## Mailing Lists {#mailinglist}

There are two mailing lists:
1. **Announcements list (public-wai-announce)** &mdash; for WAI announcements only.
2. **Discussion list (w3c-wai-ig)** &mdash; for WAI announcements and public discussion. All e-mails sent to the Announcements list will also go to this Discussion list, so you don't need to subscribe to both lists. If you want to send messages to the list, you must send them from an e-mail address that is subscribed to the list.

Details are below.

### Announcements List - Subscribing and Unsubscribing

* To subscribe, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:public-wai-announce-request@w3.org?subject=subscribe">public-wai-announce-request@w3.org with subject: &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo;</a>.
* To unsubscribe, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:public-wai-announce-request@w3.org?subject=unsubscribe">public-wai-announce-request@w3.org with subject: &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo;</a>.

You can also see the [Announcements List Archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wai-announce/).

### Using the Discussion List

[Discussion List Archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/) are useful for
searching for past messages and getting a feel for the list.

-   E-mail messages should **contribute to a comfortable, constructive
    exchange** of ideas to advance web accessibility. Before you write
    an e-mail, think about how it will come across to the hundreds of
    people around the world who are on the list.
    -   **Be respectful.** Be positive. Be open to different
        perspectives.
    -   **Provide constructive information.** Focus on developing
        solutions, rather than just complaining.
    -   Avoid personal attacks, naming calling, and such.
    -   Explain the issue clearly. Provide sufficient background
        information.
-   Make sure e-mails are related web accessibility and are appropriate
    for the WAI IG list.
    -   If you have questions about whether or not a message is
        appropriate for the WAI IG list, contact
        **[Shawn](http://w3.org/People/Shawn/)**.
    -   When your comments are not useful for the entire list, **reply
        off-list** — that is, reply directly to the sender and do not
        send the message to the list.
    -   No soliciting.
-   Formatting messages:
    -   Use a Subject line that describes the topic well. If you change
        topics, change the Subject. This is usually handled as follows:<br>
        `New Topic XYZ [was: Old Topic]`
    -   Keep your reply comments near the top of a message, and only
        quote essential parts of a previous message at the top — so
        there are few quote markings for readers to wade through.
    -   If you use a vacation auto-responder, exclude responses to mail
        with w3c-wai-ig@w3.org in any header.<br>
-   **Send any questions about the WAI IG mailing list to
    <shawn@w3.org>**, not to the whole list.
    
See additional guidancce in the **W3C Code of Ethics**: [Positive Work Environment at W3C: Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).    

### Subscribing and Unsubscribing to the Discussion List

-   **To subscribe** to the list, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org?subject=subscribe">w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org with subject: &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo;</a>.
-   **To unsubscribe** from the list, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org?subject=unsubscribe">w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org with subject: &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo;</a>.

**Please note**: The subscription e-mail addresses are different from
the e-mail address to send an e-mail message, which is in the next
section.

To subscribe to the email **digest** with compiled messages, send e-mail
to <w3c-wai-ig-d-request@w3.org> with "subscribe" as the subject. To
unsubscribe from the digest, send e-mail to
<w3c-wai-ig-d-request@w3.org> with "unsubscribe" as the subject.

### Sending Messages to the Discussion List

To send a message to the list, first subscribe to the list (instructions
above), then send your message to
[w3c-wai-ig@w3.org](mailto:w3c-wai-ig@w3.org)

**The first time you send a message to a public W3C mailing list**, you
will get a reply e-mail asking if you will give permission for your
message to be distributed to the list and thus go into the public
archive. There is an option to do this once and then you don't have to
do it again in the future.
