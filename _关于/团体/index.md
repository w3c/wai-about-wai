WAI has Working Groups developing accessibility guidelines and related
work, and Interest Groups providing a forum for discussing Web
accessibility issues. **[Participating in WAI](/get-involved/)**
describes generally how to participate in WAI work. To find out more

them; see Task Force link below.
